# block-volume-attacher
block-volume-attacher provides an image which performs the attach of block volumes on any desired node. It also does the detach of the volumes which are no longer needed.

## Steps to attach the SoftLayer block volume on the worker node of the cluster

#### Pre-requisites:
1. Ensure the following `environment` variables are set:
* SL_API_KEY
* SL_USERNAME
* BM_API_KEY
1. Ensure that the Python `Softlayer` package has been installed:
```
pip install softlayer
```
See : http://softlayer-api-python-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/

1. Login to cluster by using `bx login` command
1. Initialise the `bx sl` to your account used in cluster.
	```
	bx sl init
	```
#### Create remote block devices and allow host access
1. Create a parameter file of the following form, called `yamlgen.yaml` in the current working directory
```
#
# Can only specify 'performance' OR 'endurance' and associated clause
#
cluster:  mypxcluster       #  name of IKS cluster
region:   us-east           #  cluster region
type:  endurance            #  performance | endurance
offering: storage_as_a_service   #  storage_as_a_service | enterprise | performance
# performance:
#    - iops:  100          #   INTEGER between 100 and 1000 in multiples of 100
endurance:
  - tier:  0.25              #   [0.25|2|4|10]
size:  [ 20 ]                #   list:  number of disks per worker node to be created, of a given size
```

For this parameter file, the `size` array indicated the number and size
of remote block devices that will be created for each worker node in the cluster.
The 'size' array takes volume size as a comma-separated list input. A volume will then be created for each of the sizes given in the array and for every worker node in the cluster.
Ensure that the length of the `size` array corresponds to the number of desired remote block devices per worker node.
For example:  'size: [ 20, 50 ]'  will create 2 disks per worker node, with corresponding sizes 20G and 50G.

Please ensure that the `region` corresponds to the region where your existing IKS cluster resides.

#### Run the block volume creation script

```
chmod +x mkpvyaml
./mkpvyaml
```

#### Attach the block volume on the worker node
1. Download the docker image file `block-volume-attacher.tar`.
1. Use command `docker load` to load it locally on your system.
	```
	docker load < block-volume-attacher.tar
	docker images
	REPOSITORY                                                                 TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
	registry.ng.bluemix.net/akgunjal/armada-block-volume-attacher   latest              7b0ba7a4151c        2 hours ago         88.7MB
	```
1. Perform the `bx login` with your Bluemix account.
1. After bx login, run the command `bx cr login` to login into the registry.
1. Use an existing namespace from the `bx cr namespaces` command or create a new namespace using `bx cr namespace-add` command. This namespace is needed to store images in the IBM Cloud Container Registry.
1. Tag the docker image loaded in `STEP 2` with the registry and using your namespace where you want to store the image.
	```
	docker images
	REPOSITORY                                                                 TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
	registry.ng.bluemix.net/akgunjal/armada-block-volume-attacher   latest              7b0ba7a4151c        2 hours ago         88.7MB

	docker tag registry.ng.bluemix.net/akgunjal/armada-block-volume-attacher registry.ng.bluemix.net/<YOUR NAMESPACE>/armada-block-volume-attacher
	```
1. Push the docker image to the registry onto your namespace. 
	```
	docker push registry.ng.bluemix.net/<YOUR NAMESPACE>/armada-block-volume-attacher
	```
1. You will now see the image in `bx cr images`.
1. Edit the `ds.yaml` file to change the image with the one stored on the registry.
1. Deploy the daemon set and check the pods in kube-system namespace on your cluster to see it should be running.
```
kubectl apply -f ds.yaml
```
1. Create the storage class using `class.yaml` file.
```
kubectl apply -f class.yaml
```
1. Wait until all the corresponds pods are running
```
$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep dsattach
dsattach-hwtpz                                                    1/1       Running   0          24s
dsattach-w952d                                                    1/1       Running   0          24s
dsattach-xl6bs                                                    1/1       Running   0          24s
```
1. Create the persistent volume using the `pv.yaml` file, which was generated by the `mkpvyaml` script above. 
This will attach the block volume on the worker node. 
`kubectl describe pv` command will show the status as `attached` and the annotations will also contain 
the device path (Example: `/dev/dm-0`) which indicates the successful attach of the volume.
1.  Verify that a `/dev/dm-X` device has been created for all the PV's before proceeding.
```
$ kubectl describe pv kube-wdc07-cr43d37fc1fc5a4801acb7404054baa3aa-w2-pv1  | grep dm
                 ibm.io/dm=/dev/dm-0
```

Make note of all the `/dev/dm-X` devices that are attached.

## Detach the block volume on the worker node
Delete the persistent volume to detach the block volume from the worker node.
